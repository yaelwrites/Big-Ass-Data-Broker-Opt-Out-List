This list, also known as BADBOOL, was started in September 2017 and was most recently updated on June 22, 2025 to update the PeekYou and Veripages opt-out URLs, update information on credit freezes, to add information on Spokeo, to add Ofsearch, Private Eye, and Unmask to the list, and to remove Peoplefinders since opting out of SmartBackgroundChecks seems to lead to removal from that broker and is free. We also changed ‚ò† üíêicons to just üíê. 

_NOTE: THIS LIST WILL BE REORDERED BY PRIORITY IN THE NEXT UPDATE, SO PLEASE MAKE A COPY NOW IF THIS WILL MESS UP YOUR PROCESS._

How to use this page: We recommend opting out of high-priority sites first. If you only have the time and patience for 14, start with sites marked üíê. If you can do 22, go to sites marked ‚ò†. Once you‚Äôve completed all of those, you can start to work your way through the rest of the list. 

Please send corrections or updates to <yael@yaelwrites.com> using the subject line ‚ÄúBADBOOL,‚Äù or file a pull request. (You can find other ways to reach me [on the contact page on my website](https://yaelwrites.com/contact).) Screenshots in emails are incredibly helpful. I add opt-out info only if users can verify that the data broker has their information before sharing additional data, and where removal is not limited to local laws like GDPR, CCPA, etc.

_Disclaimers: Some of these opt-outs take a long time to go through. Sometimes, information is pulled from other sources and you‚Äôll need to opt out multiple times for the same site. Data brokers come and go (and are bought out by others), and they also often change their opt-out pages. I update this regularly, but it‚Äôs not always current. There are sites I either don‚Äôt know about or do not include because there is no free way to see if they have data before requesting removal, or to provide the specific URLs needed for removal. Finally, even opting out of these sites doesn‚Äôt mean that your address is secure. In many states, real estate data and voter registration information is public (or easy to obtain). And, of course, location data can be found by physical means (e.g., following you home) and through other people who know it (i.e., social engineering). That said, removing your home address from data broker sites can significantly lower your attack surface and make it harder for people to find it. üíï_

## Search Engines
If you've been doxed, you can remove your contact info [from Google Search](https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/3111061) and [from Bing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/concern/bing).

Google allows you to remove non-consensual or intimate personal images, involuntary fake pornography, irrelevant pornography from Google search results for your name, content about you on sites with exploitative removal practices, and several other categories of information.

Google has a free service called [Results About You](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/12719076), that allows you to search for your data and ask for it to be deindexed.

## People Search Sites

### ‚ò† Acxiom

It is hard to find your own info for free, but people in some countries can opt out using the following links:
[Portail des droits des consommateurs | Acxiom](https://www.acxiom.com/privacy/fr/) (France)
[Portale delle preferenze dei consumatori | Acxiom](https://www.acxiom.com/privacy/it/) (Italy)
[Portal de preferencia del consumidor | Acxiom](https://www.acxiom.com/privacy/es/) (Spain)
[US Consumer Opt Out | Acxiom](https://www.acxiom.com/optout/) (U.S.)

Users in Austria, Germany, India and Switzerland may email <Datenschutz@acxiom.com>.

Other international requests should go to the [Acxiom Consumer International Rights Portal](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/342ca6ac-4177-4827-b61e-19070296cbd3/6896cf25-6953-4500-9c69-5a8fb6f6f932).

If you don‚Äôt have an email address, call (877) 774-2094 and follow the prompts.

### ‚ò† Advanced Background Checks
First, [search for your information](https://www.advancedbackgroundchecks.com). Remember that you can leave your city, state, and age blank. If your information shows up, [remove your data](https://www.advancedbackgroundchecks.com/removal).

### ‚ò† Ancestry.com
While you can‚Äôt see all of your data without a paid account, Ancestry will delete information if you email links that would redirect you to the proper site if you had an account. [Sign up for a free account](https://www.ancestry.com/account/) (not a free trial!), and then search for your information on the sidebar. Click on everything that includes a state you have ever lived at, even if it‚Äôs not your current state. Cut and paste the URLs, even if they all direct to a sales page, and email them to [privacy@ancestry.com](mailto:privacy@ancestry.com). Alternatively, you can submit individual URLs via [this content removal form](https://support.ancestry.com/s/reportissue?language=en_US).

### Archives
To find your information, you must [sign up for a free trial](https://www.archives.com/search/ancestor/checkout) (and then cancel). Then, [opt out](https://www.archives.com/Optout) if you found your data.

### Best of History Websites
[Find your information](https://besthistorysites.net/), and then paste the URL into the [opt-out form](https://besthistorysites.net/opt-out). Then, type in your email address on the following page and click on the "remove" link. You'll need to click on the opt-out link sent to you via email.

### ‚ò† üíê BeenVerified
Find your information and opt out of [people search](https://www.beenverified.com/app/optout/search) and [property search](https://www.beenverified.com/app/optout/address-search). BeenVerified also owns PeopleLooker and PeopleSmart. Be aware that BeenVerified only allows one opt-out per email address, so you may need to reach out via email for additional opt-outs. You will need to confirm your opt-out request by clicking on a link sent to you via email.

### ‚ò† üíê CheckPeople
Look for [your contact info](https://checkpeople.com/do-not-sell-info). If it shows up, select your record for removal. You will need to fill out your name and email and solve a captcha.  You will receive an email which will require you to confirm your opt-out request.

### Classmates.com
Cancel your free or paid membership following [these instructions](https://help.classmates.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002224171-How-can-I-cancel-my-membership-).

### ‚ò† üíê ClustrMaps
[Find your information](https://clustrmaps.com/), and then [remove it](https://clustrmaps.com/bl/opt-out). It will ask you to check off anything associated with your account that you want removed.

### CocoFinder
[Look for your information](https://cocofinder.com/search) and then [opt out](https://cocofinder.com/remove-my-info). You will be sent to a [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEgLH9ro7oQR4c0V9E19ug1Gb7wVMrFFSj0Sgx4sjba_ET4Q/viewform).

### Cyber Background Checks
Look for [your information](https://www.cyberbackgroundchecks.com/) and [opt out](https://www.cyberbackgroundchecks.com/removal). 

### ‚ò† Dataveria
[Find your information](https://dataveria.com/). Opt out by entering the specific profile URL you find into the [opt-out form](https://dataveria.com/ng/control/privacy). You will need to confirm your opt-out request by clicking on a link sent to you via email. If the opt-out form doesn‚Äôt work, you can send each profile URL in a separate email to <support@federal-data.com>, but the company may redirect you back to the site that doesn‚Äôt work. (The link currently on the site bounces.) Stand by for an update once we find a more consistent working method. 

### Facecheck
[Facecheck.id](https://Facecheck.id) is reverse image search software that uses an uploaded image to locate your face across in photos and videos on major social media platforms. If this type of search is something you are concerned about, you can [remove your face from its search engine](https://facecheck.id/Face-Search/RemoveMyPhotos) by searching for your image, uploading a driver‚Äôs license or ID card (you can hide your name, address and ID number) or a selfie with your face and two fingers touching your chin. Note that this will not remove your image from the various websites on which it was found, but simply will not allow people to search for it on the Facecheck site. Facecheck also states that it makes an exception for violent criminals.

### FamilySearch
[Sign up for a free account](https://www.familysearch.org/) and [search historical records](https://www.familysearch.org/search/). Copy the URLs for the records with your information, and [submit this opt-out form](https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/b8d6e704-e5b1-42a0-9f86-bbdec35939a1). You will need to verify your email address. 

### ‚ò† FamilyTreeNow
Search for yourself and [remove your information](https://www.familytreenow.com/optout).

### ‚ò† FastPeopleSearch.com
Look for and [remove your information](https://www.fastpeoplesearch.com/removal). You may need to solve a captcha.

### FreePeopleDirectory
[Search for your information](https://www.freepeopledirectory.com). If you find it, you can opt out on [Spokeo‚Äôs opt-out page](https://www.spokeo.com/optout). Make sure to scroll down to the grammatically incorrect ‚Äúopt out your information‚Äù section.

### ‚ò† üíê FreePeopleSearch
Look for [your contact info](https://freepeoplesearch.com/remove-info/). If it shows up, select your record for removal. You will need to fill out your name and email and solve a captcha.  You will receive an email which will require you to confirm your opt-out request.

### HudwayGlass
[Look for your home address](https://hudwayglass.com/). If your name is listed alongside your address, click on the ‚Äúinformation control‚Äù link. Opt out of applicable phone numbers and names. There's a limit per each opt out and each email you use to opt out. You will need to click the verification link they email you to finalize the opt out.

### IDTrue
Find your information and [opt out](https://www.idtrue.com/optout/).

### ‚ò† üíê Information.com
Look for [your contact info](https://information.com/remove-my-info/). If it shows up, select your record for removal. You will need to fill out your name and email and solve a captcha.  You will receive an email which will require you to confirm your opt-out request.

### InfoTracer
[Find your information](https://www.infotracer.com) and opt out by [filling out the form](https://infotracer.com/optout/). You can also mail in [a different form](https://members.infotracer.com/tspec/shared/assets/data_opt_out_form.pdf) or fax it to 1-617-933-9946.

### ‚ò† üíê Intelius
[Find your information](https://www.intelius.com/). Opt out by emailing <support@mailer.intelius.com>, calling 1-888-245-1655, or [filling out a form](https://suppression.peopleconnect.us/login).  If you‚Äôre told that Intelius can't find your account, you may need to confirm your mailing address, phone number, old email addresses, or other information via email. (As always, make sure Intelius already has the information before providing it.) Intelius owns Addresses.com, Addresssearch.com, Anywho, Classmates, DateCheck, Instant Checkmate, InstantPeopleFinder, iSearch, LookUpAnyone, Peopleconnect.us, PeopleFinder, PeopleLookup, Phonesbook, Publicrecords, Spock, Truthfinder, US Search, and Zabasearch.

### ‚ò† üíê üìû MyLife
[Find your information](https://www.mylife.com), and then [opt out](https://www.mylife.com/ccpa/index.pubview). Although this is CCPA-focused, non-California folks have successfully removed their profiles. However, another option is to email your removal request to <privacy@mylife.com> with your name and a link to your profile. MyLife will try to get you to create an account with a copy of your driver‚Äôs license to submit a profile removal request, and we‚Äôve received reports that emailing the <info@mylife.com> or <removalrequests@mylife.com> email addresses will require a phone call to (888) 704-1900. Previously, calling that number and pressing 2 allowed you to be removed from MyLife (and Wink.com) after providing your name, age, date of birth, email address, current mailing address, and a previous mailing address, but this no longer appears to be the case. (It also appears that you can sign up for a free membership to remove your reputation profile, though not your personal information such as your home address.)

### NeighborReport
[Search for your name, address or phone number](https://neighbor.report/), and then [remove the report](https://neighbor.report/remove). You will need to verify the opt-out request via email.

### ‚ò† üíê Nuwber
[Find your information](https://nuwber.com/). Try to opt out on the [removal form](https://nuwber.com/removal/link). Try "filter by state" to isolate the "person" URL you need. Don‚Äôt bother trying to get a full report; it‚Äôll just waste your time with multiple steps and deceptive design trying to get you to pay for a subscription. If the URL you generate doesn't work in the form or you run across other problems, take a screenshot of your results and send them to <support@nuwber.com>, asking them to opt you out. 

### Ofsearch
Go to [Ofsearch‚Äôs information control page](https://ofsearch.org/control/privacy) and check for your information in the top bar. If available, copy and paste it in the form on the page, or email it to <contactus@ofsearch.org>. If there are multiple URLs, you will need to fill out a separate form for each URL, or include all of them via email.

### ‚ò† PeekYou
Look for [your information](https://www.peekyou.com) and [opt out](https://www.peekyou.com/about/contact/ccpa_optout/do_not_sell/). You will need the letters at the end of your profile‚Äôs URL in the "unique ID" field. Make sure to check "remove my entire listing." If you cannot find a unique ID, it‚Äôs possible PeekYou doesn‚Äôt have a separate profile for you. You can remove your information from the people search sites that it says it has aggregated information from by finding the instructions under the name of each site in this list.

### PeopleByName
[Look up your name](https://www.peoplebyname.com/people). Or, you can fill in your name in the URL like this: https://www.peoplebyname.com/people/[Last_Name]/[First_Name]. Opt out [for each record](https://www.peoplebyname.com/remove.php).

### PeopleSearchNow
Find your information and [opt out](https://www.peoplesearchnow.com/opt-out).

### üé´ PimEyes
PimEyes is an online face search engine that uses face recognition to perform a reverse image search, finding pictures of your face (or others like it) throughout the Internet. If you want to see if your photographs are in PimEyes‚Äô database, consider [uploading a photo](https://pimeyes.com/). (I used a very public photo that I know is already online, but you can also take a photo with your camera‚Äîwhich PimEyes claims it does not store.)  To opt out, you‚Äôll need to [upload an image of your face](https://pimeyes.com/en/opt-out-request-form), and also attach a photo ID with all sensitive data (other than your name and photograph) blurred. The easiest way to do this, in my opinion, is through Signal, the encrypted messaging app, which has a blur feature described [in its blog](https://signal.org/blog/blur-tools/). You can also use tools such as Photoshop or even make a copy of your ID and use a Sharpie. Finally, you‚Äôll need to provide your email address.

### PrivateEye
[Look for your information](https://www.privateeye.com/) and [initiate the opt-out](https://www.privateeye.com/removal), if needed. You will receive a link for a record removal form that you‚Äôll have to fill out. 

### PrivateRecords
Search for your name and state and [opt out](https://www.privaterecords.net/optOut/name/landing).

### ‚ò† üíê PublicDataUSA
Find [your information](https://www.publicdatausa.com/). Copy the URL with your results and enter it along with your name and email address on the [remove page](https://www.publicdatausa.com/remove.php).

### ‚ò† üíê PublicRecord
Look for [your contact info](https://publicrecord.com/opt-me-out/). If it shows up, select your record for removal. You will need to fill out your name and email and solve a captcha.  You will receive an email which will require you to confirm your opt-out request.

### PropertyRecs
Search for your name and state in the [opt-out page](https://dashboard.propertyrecs.com/opt-out), then opt out if needed.

### ‚ò† üíê Radaris
Find [your information](https://radaris.com/). Make sure the site you are clicking on is a Radaris link, rather than OneRep or Nuwber. (It is possible you do not have a Radaris listing.) Once you find your information, copy the URL as you‚Äôll need it when you fill out [a series of forms](https://radaris.com/control-privacy), hitting ‚Äúnext‚Äù and waiting for new pages to load. 

### Rehold
Look up your home address here: [https://rehold.com/](https://rehold.com/). If there is a number or name next to it you‚Äôd like removed, click on  the red ‚Äúremove‚Äù button next to it. You will need to enter your name and email address and solve a captcha.

### üí∞ Searchbug
Unfortunately, you have to sign up with a credit card to search for [your information](https://www.searchbug.com/), though your first search is free. You can contact Searchbug using the [contact form or chat link](https://www.searchbug.com/contact-us.aspx) or via phone or text at (760) 454-7301 or via fax at (760) 454-7341 to ask them to block the display of your personal information.

### SearchPeopleFree
Find [your information](https://www.searchpeoplefree.com/), making sure to search by name, phone number, address and email address: [Opt out](https://www.searchpeoplefree.com/opt-out).

### SearchQuarry
Find [your information](https://www.searchquarry.com/). If it‚Äôs listed, [opt out](https://members.searchquarry.com/removeMyData/) You will need to click the verification link in your inbox to finalize the opt out.

### ‚ò† üíê SmartBackgroundChecks
Find [your information](https://www.smartbackgroundchecks.com/). Then, [opt out](https://www.smartbackgroundchecks.com/optout). This will likely also remove your information from PeopleFinders. 

### Social Catfish
Find [your information](https://socialcatfish.com). Record the URL of each page that has your information. Then, go to the [opt-out page](https://socialcatfish.com/opt-out/) and scroll down to the instructions for removing URLs, email, phone number, and address. (Make sure to only ask for information to be removed if you already see it on the site.) You‚Äôll need to provide your email address and click on a confirmation link to complete the opt-out process.

### ‚ò† üíê üí∞ Spokeo
Find [your information](https://www.spokeo.com/search) and remove your information by entering the URL of the profile you want removed and your email address on the [opt-out page](https://www.spokeo.com/optout). Make sure to scroll down to the grammatically incorrect ‚Äúopt out your information‚Äù section. You will need to confirm your opt-out request by clicking on a link sent to you via email. Unfortunately, we‚Äôve received reports that Spokeo retains removed information for paid accounts, even if it doesn‚Äôt show up in free searches. It may be worth paying for a $1 trial to see if the data is still showing up even after you have opted out.

### SpyFly
Look for [your data](https://www.spyfly.com). Then, [opt out](https://www.spyfly.com/help-center/remove-my-public-record). You can also try emailing <support@spyfly.com>. You‚Äôll need to provide your name, age, address, and email address. Make sure SpyFly has information you'd like removed before volunteering these things.

### ‚ò† üíê That‚Äôs Them
Find [your information](https://thatsthem.com/). If it shows up, try to [opt out](https://thatsthem.com/optout). Do not click on the Spokeo identity theft protection link, as it is a paid product.

### TruePeopleSearch
Follow the [removal instructions](https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/removal). You will need to enter your  name, city and state, and email address, and then you‚Äôll need to solve several captchas to see if you are listed, after which you can remove your information.

### United States Phone Book
Search for [your information](https://www.unitedstatesphonebook.com/search.php).
If your address is listed and you want it removed, enter the telephone number and zip code listed on the above site [in this page](https://www.unitedstatesphonebook.com/contact.php).

### ‚ò† üíê UnMask
Look for [your contact info](https://unmask.com/opt-out/). If it shows up, select your record for removal. You will need to fill out your name and email and solve a captcha.  You will receive an email which will require you to confirm your opt-out request.

### USA People Search
Find and [remove your information](https://www.usa-people-search.com/manage).

### USA-Official
After finding your information, [enter your name and URL](https://usa-official.com/remove.php).

### ‚ò† USPhoneBook
Look for your number and [opt out](https://www.usphonebook.com/opt-out/).

### Verecor
Find [your information](https://verecor.com). To opt out, [enter the profile URL](https://verecor.com/ng/control/privacy), along with your name and email. You will need to fill out a captcha, and confirm the email link to finalize your request. If it doesn‚Äôt go through, you may need to email <assist@verecor.com>. (If you opt-out of Verecor and try to out-out of Vericora (or the reverse), you will get an error stating: "You have exceeded the maximum number of requests per person." It's not clear if either site respects an opt-out on the other, so use a separate browser session and email to opt-out of each.)

### Vericora
Find [your information](https://vericora.com/profile/search) and [opt out](https://vericora.com/ng/control/privacy). (If you opt-out of Verecor and try to out-out of Vericora (or the reverse), you will get an error stating: "You have exceeded the maximum number of requests per person." It's not clear if either site respects an opt-out on the other, so use a separate browser session and email to opt-out of each.)

### Veripages
Find [your information](https://veripages.com/). To opt out, [enter the profile URL](https://veripages.com/inner/control-privacy), along with your name and email. You will need to fill out a captcha, and confirm the email link to finalize your request.

### VoterRecords
Go to [VoterRecords.com](https://voterrecords.com/), find your information, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the"record opt-out" link. This will lead to an opt-out form, which you‚Äôll need to submit. You may receive a verification link you‚Äôll need to click on to verify your opt-out request.

### ‚ò† üíê üìû üí∞ White Pages
Find [your information](https://www.whitepages.com/), and then [opt out](https://www.whitepages.com/suppression_requests). You will need to provide a phone number and enter an opt-out code when you receive the phone call. Opt-out information [is available](https://support.whitepages.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010106908-How-do-I-edit-or-remove-a-personal-listing). You can also [send a request form](https://support.whitepages.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). (I am including multiple options because these sites have a tendency to disappear.) Sometimes, information is removed from White Pages but not White Pages Premium, so make sure to double-check for your listing. Unfortunately, it may not be possible to opt out of White Pages Premium pages without an account. White Pages also owns [411.com](https://www.411.com/), so check for your information there. The opt-out is the same. You may need to verify your opt-out by receiving an automated voice call and entering a four-digit code into your phone.

### ZoomInfo
Check to see if your information is on ZoomInfo by [filling out this form](https://privacyrequest.zoominfo.com/remove/verify). Opt out if it has an email on record‚Äîthey will email you a code. ZoomInfo appears to have moved towards focusing primarily on business rather than individuals.

## Special Circumstances

If you‚Äôre a victim of violent crime or identity theft, it‚Äôs often possible to opt out of information that others can‚Äôt opt out of. You may, however, need to provide court orders or other information. It may be worth checking more complete data broker lists which include those: [https://www.privacyrights.org/data-brokers](https://www.privacyrights.org/data-brokers). See this resource: [https://nnedv.org/mdocs-posts/people-searches-data-brokers/](https://nnedv.org/mdocs-posts/people-searches-data-brokers/).

If you are experiencing or have experienced domestic violence, sexual abuse, or stalking, you may be able to keep your address private through state programs that provide a substitute address and mail forwarding. To see if a program exists in your state, look up ‚Äúaddress confidentiality program‚Äù along with the name of your state in a search engine.

If you are a healthcare worker with a National Provider Index (NPI) number, your personal cell phone number or home address may be showing up on various online directories and websites because they were listed as primary contact information when you filled out your NPI profile (or when someone else filled it out on your behalf). CMS now provides the option of using a post office box instead of a home address if you do not have a physical practice address.

Look up your information here: [https://opennpi.com/provider/](https://opennpi.com/provider/). You can update or remove information by filling out this form: [https://opennpi.com/contact](https://opennpi.com/contact). You‚Äôll also need to reach out to any sites aggregating this data, like Doximity, where you may be able to [edit](https://support.doximity.com/hc/en-us/articles/9349631650323-How-to-Update-Edit-Your-Profile-on-the-Doximity-Website) or [delete](https://support.doximity.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039340393-How-to-Delete-Your-Doximity-Profile) your profile.

## Preventing Identity Theft & Opting Out of Marketing Sites

- TransUnion: 1 (888) 909-8872, <https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze> or <https://service.transunion.com/dss/orderStep1_form.page>
- Innovis: 1 (800) 540-2505, <https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityFreeze> or <https://www.innovis.com/securityFreeze/index>

### Contact your home and mobile phone companies to see if they offer privacy options, such as not listing your number on caller ID or allowing you to opt out of sales of phone numbers.

### Consider opting out of direct marketing and telemarketing.
This list, compiled by Griffin Boyce, has a lot of information on doing so: [https://github.com/glamrock/data-brokers/blob/master/data-brokers.md](https://github.com/glamrock/data-brokers/blob/master/data-brokers.md). It was last updated in 2019.

You can also opt out of targeted ads using cookies and similar technology at the browser level at https://optout.aboutads.info.

### Opt out of prescreened credit offers
Follow the instructions at [https://www.optoutprescreen.com/](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/)

### Get on the Do Not Call Registry

### Additional Options (Paid and Free)

While there are over a dozen different data broker opt-out services, I personally use and recommend [EasyOptOuts](https://easyoptouts.com/). For more information on people search site removal services, see [the evaluation I conducted at Consumer Reports in partnership with Tall Poppy](https://innovation.consumerreports.org/new-report-data-defense-evaluating-people-search-site-removal-services/).

In general, note that removal services are not comprehensive, as some data brokers do not allow third parties to remove listings, and removal services do not include every data broker on this list, let alone outside of it. You can fill in the gaps using [this handy chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/115L6LpQg_UX638IyUfdwGhRS7dIU3lKwz6fjAcDtE-0/).

There are services for media mail as well. For a fee, [PaperKarma](https://www.paperkarma.com/product/paperkarma-subscription/) will remove your name from common direct mail vendors, including charity solicitations, direct mail and catalogs. You¬†can also remove your name from [Valpak coupon packs](https://www.valpak.com/remove-address), for free. Sign up for a free account at [https://www.catalogchoice.org/](https://www.catalogchoice.org/) to cancel catalogs you no longer wish to receive. For a fee, [DMAChoice](https://dmachoice.org/static/consumer_choice_tools.php), will remove your name from prospective mailers, not including political mail or mail from companies you‚Äôve done business with in the past two years. DMAChoice also maintains a Deceased Do Not Contact list to allow you to remove names of deceased individuals for marketing lists, which you can register for [here](https://www.ims-dm.com/cgi/ddnc.php). (I am sorry for your loss!)

There are several free services available as well. [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) allows you to check to see if your email address has been involved in a data breach. The free tier of [Mozilla Monitor](https://monitor.mozilla.org/) allows you to search up to five email addresses to see if your information is exposed in data breaches or found on data broker sites, and gives step-by-step instructions on removal. 

### Shameless Self-Promotion

Online privacy and security work hand in hand. There are important steps to take to secure your personal data beyond finding and removing it from people search sites. For my day job, I manage Consumer Reports‚Äô [Security Planner](https://securityplanner.consumerreports.org/), a free, easy-to-use guide to staying safer online. Check it out for personalized recommendations and expert advice on topics such as keeping social media accounts from being hacked, locking down smart speakers and home security cameras, and reducing intrusive tracking by websites. This tool builds upon the work of the Citizen Lab, which originally launched and managed the project.
