Please send corrections or updates to [yael@yaelwrites.com](mailto:yael@yaelwrites.com). I will add opt-outs where users can verify that the data broker has their information before providing it, and where removal is not limited to GDPR/CCPA/etc.

_Disclaimers: Some of these opt-outs take a long time to go through. Sometimes, information is pulled from other sources and you’ll need to opt out multiple times for the same site. Data brokers come and go (and are bought out by others), and they also often change their opt-out pages. I try to update this ~every six months, but it’s not always current. Finally, even opting out of these sites doesn’t mean that your address is secure. In many states, real estate data and voter registration information is public (or easy to obtain). And, of course, location data can be found by physical means (e.g., following you home) and through other people who know it (i.e., social engineering). That said, removing your home address from data broker sites can significantly lower your attack surface and make it harder for people to find it. 💕_

### ☠ 📞 MyLife
Find your information here: [https://www.mylife.com](https://www.mylife.com/). 
Opt out using the following URL: [https://www.mylife.com/ccpa/index.pubview](https://www.mylife.com/ccpa/index.pubview). Although this is CCPA-focused, non-California folks have successfully removed their profiles. However, another option is to email your removal request to [privacy@mylife.com](mailto:privacy@mylife.com) with your name and a link to your profile. MyLife will try to get you to create an account with a copy of your driver’s license to submit a profile removal request, and we’ve received reports that emailing the [info@mylife.com](mailto:info@mylife.com) or [removalrequests@mylife.com](mailto:removalrequests@mylife.com) email addresses will require a phone call to (888) 704-1900. Previously, calling that number and pressing 2 allowed you to be removed from MyLife (and Wink.com) after providing your name, age, date of birth, email address, current mailing address, and a previous mailing address, but this no longer appears to be the case. (It also appears that you can sign up for a free membership to remove your reputation profile, though not your personal information such as your home address.)

You will need the letters at the end of your profile’s URL in the &quot;unique ID&quot; field. Make sure to check &quot;remove my entire listing.&quot; You can also remove your information from the sites that it says it has aggregated information from.

### 💰 PeopleByName
Look up your name here: [http://www.peoplebyname.com/people](http://www.peoplebyname.com/people). Or, you can fill in your name in the URL like this: http://www.peoplebyname.com/people/[Last_Name]/[First_Name]. Opt out for each record here: [http://www.peoplebyname.com/remove.php](http://www.peoplebyname.com/remove.php)

### 💰 SearchBug

Click the links to search for your last name. Then do the same for your first name. You will get to a results page. Click each name listing, and suppress it by clicking the "Request Removal" link at the bottom of the page, entering the URL in the contact form it takes you to, and providing your email address. You can also email your removal request to [feedback@readwritelabs.com](mailto:feedback@readwritelabs.com). Unfortunately, Spoke’s opt-out page is working—its link from the FAQ page is dead.

Sometimes, information is removed from White Pages but not White Pages Premium, so make sure to double-check for your listing. Also, White Pages also owns [411.com](https://www.411.com/), so check for your information there. The opt-out is the same.

### Xlek
(formerly Cubib?) Look up your information at [https://www.xlek.com/](https://www.xlek.com/). Opt out at [https://www.xlek.com/optout.php](https://www.xlek.com/optout.php). You’ll need to submit a separate opt-out request for each item you’d like removed

### � ZoomInfo
Check to see if your information is on ZoomInfo by filling out this form:[https://www.zoominfo.com/update/remove](https://www.zoominfo.com/update/remove). Opt out if it has an email on record—they will email you a code. ZoomInfo appears to have moved towards focusing primarily on business rather than individuals.

## Special Circumstances

If you’re a victim of violent crime or identity theft, it’s often possible to opt out of information that others can’t opt out of. You may, however, need to provide court orders or other information. It may be worth checking more complete data broker lists which include those: [https://www.privacyrights.org/data-brokers](https://www.privacyrights.org/data-brokers) See this resource: [https://nnedv.org/mdocs-posts/people-searches-data-brokers/](https://nnedv.org/mdocs-posts/people-searches-data-brokers/).

If you are experiencing or have experienced domestic violence, sexual abuse, or stalking, you may be able to keep your address private through state programs that provide a substitute address and mail forwarding. To see if a program exists in your state, look up “address confidentiality program” along with the name of your state in a search engine.

If you are a healthcare worker with a National Provider Index (NPI) number, your personal cell phone number or home address may be showing up on various online directories and websites because they were listed as primary contact information when you filled out your NPI profile (or when someone else filled it out on your behalf).
Look up your information here: [https://opennpi.com/provider/](https://opennpi.com/provider/). You can update or remove information by filling out this form: [https://opennpi.com/contact](https://opennpi.com/contact). You’ll also need to reach out to any sites aggregating this data, like Doximity, where you may be able to edit or delete your profile. 

## Preventing Identity Theft &amp; Opting Out of Marketing Sites

### 📞 Consider freezing your credit
which prevents creditors from accessing your credit report. (It also prevents credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name, but you will receive a pin to unfreeze your credit, if needed.) You will need to provide personal information such as your name, address, date of birth, and social security number to freeze your credit. While you can sometimes initiate this online, it’s better to do it by phone. Fees for freezing your credit [vary by state](http://consumersunion.org/research/consumers-unions-guide-to-security-freeze-protection-2/). To freeze your credit, contact:

- Equifax: 1 (800) 349-9960, [https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/](https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/)
- Experian: 1 (888) 397‑3742, [https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html](https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html) or [https://www.experian.com/ncaconline/freeze](https://www.experian.com/ncaconline/freeze)
- TransUnion: 1 (888) 909-8872, [https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze) or [https://service.transunion.com/dss/orderStep1_form.page](https://service.transunion.com/dss/orderStep1_form.page)
- Innovis: 1 (800) 540-2505, [https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityFreeze](https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityFreeze) or [https://www.innovis.com/securityFreeze/index](https://www.innovis.com/securityFreeze/index)

### Explore any privacy options
offered by your state’s motor vehicle department.

### Contact your home and mobile phone companies
to see if they offer privacy options, such as not listing your number on caller ID or allowing you to opt out of sales of phone numbers.

### Consider opting out of direct marketing and telemarketing.
This list, compiled by Griffin Boyce, has a lot of information on doing so: [https://github.com/glamrock/data-brokers/blob/master/data-brokers.md](https://github.com/glamrock/data-brokers/blob/master/data-brokers.md). 

You can also opt out of targeted ads using cookies and similar technology at the browser level at https://optout.aboutads.info.

### Opt out of prescreened credit offers
Follow the instructions at [https://www.optoutprescreen.com/](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/)

### Get on the Do Not Call Registry
[https://www.donotcall.gov/register/reg.aspx](https://www.donotcall.gov/register/reg.aspx)

## Paid options

[Brand Yourself](https://brandyourself.com/), [DeleteMe](https://joindeleteme.com/), [DeleteMeNow](https://deletemenow.com/), [EasyOptOuts](https://easyoptouts.com/), [IDX Privacy](https://www.idx.us/idx-privacy), [Kanary](https://www.thekanary.com/), [OneRep](https://onerep.com/), [Optery](https://www.optery.com), [Privacy Pros](https://privacypros.io/), [Spartacus](https://spartacus.com), [Removaly](https://removaly.com/), [Reputation Defender](https://www.reputationdefender.com/), and [Reputation.com](Reputation.com) all offer different opt-out services. Of these options, I have personally paid for and had good experiences with DeleteMe and Kanary. In general, note that removal services are not comprehensive, as some data brokers do not allow third parties to remove listings, and removal services do not include every data broker on this list, let alone outside of it.
