# Big Ass Data Broker Opt-Out List

| Symbols | Meanings                                             |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ò†       | high priority                                        |
| üé´      | requires driver‚Äôs license (cross out your ID #!)     |
| üì´      | must use snail mail                                  |
| üí∞      | site charges money for access or removal (whaaaat?)  |

This list was started on September 29, 2017 and was most recently updated in May 2023 to add information on sites that require you to click links sent via email or to receive an automated call and enter a four-digit number on your phone in order to complete an opt-out request.

Please send corrections or updates to [yael@yaelwrites.com](mailto:yael@yaelwrites.com), or file a pull request. Screenshots in emails are incredibly helpful. I will add opt-outs where users can verify that the data broker has their information before providing it, and where removal is not limited to GDPR/CCPA/etc.

_Disclaimers: Some of these opt-outs take a long time to go through. Sometimes, information is pulled from other sources and you‚Äôll need to opt out multiple times for the same site. Data brokers come and go (and are bought out by others), and they also often change their opt-out pages. I try to update this ~every six months, but it‚Äôs not always current. Finally, even opting out of these sites doesn‚Äôt mean that your address is secure. In many states, real estate data and voter registration information is public (or easy to obtain). And, of course, location data can be found by physical means (e.g., following you home) and through other people who know it (i.e., social engineering). That said, removing your home address from data broker sites can significantly lower your attack surface and make it harder for people to find it. üíï_

Although this is CCPA-focused, non-California folks have successfully removed their profiles. However, another option is to email your removal request to [privacy@mylife.com](mailto:privacy@mylife.com) with your name and a link to your profile. MyLife will try to get you to create an account with a copy of your driver‚Äôs license to submit a profile removal request, and we‚Äôve received reports that emailing the [info@mylife.com](mailto:info@mylife.com) or [removalrequests@mylife.com](mailto:removalrequests@mylife.com) email addresses will require a phone call to¬†(888) 704-1900. Previously, calling that number and pressing 2 allowed you to be removed from MyLife (and Wink.com) after providing your name, age, date of birth, email address, current mailing address, and a previous mailing address, but this no longer appears to be the case. (It also appears that you can sign up for a free membership to remove your reputation profile, though not your personal information such as your home address.)

## Special Circumstances

If you‚Äôre a victim of violent crime or identity theft, it‚Äôs often possible to opt out of information that others can‚Äôt opt out of. You may, however, need to provide court orders or other information. It may be worth checking more complete data broker lists which include those: [https://www.privacyrights.org/data-brokers](https://www.privacyrights.org/data-brokers) See this resource: [https://nnedv.org/mdocs-posts/people-searches-data-brokers/](https://nnedv.org/mdocs-posts/people-searches-data-brokers/).

If you are experiencing or have experienced domestic violence, sexual abuse, or stalking, you may be able to keep your address private through state programs that provide a substitute address and mail forwarding. To see if a program exists in your state, look up ‚Äúaddress confidentiality program‚Äù along with the name of your state in a search engine.

If you are a healthcare worker with a National Provider Index (NPI) number, your personal cell phone number or home address may be showing up on various online directories and websites because they were listed as primary contact information when you filled out your NPI profile (or when someone else filled it out on your behalf).
Look up your information here: [https://opennpi.com/provider/](https://opennpi.com/provider/). You can update or remove information by filling out this form: [https://opennpi.com/contact](https://opennpi.com/contact).

## Preventing Identity Theft & Opting Out of Marketing Sites

### üìû Consider freezing your credit, which prevents creditors from accessing your credit report. 
(It also prevents credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name, but you will receive a pin to unfreeze your credit, if needed.) You will need to provide personal information such as your name, address, date of birth, and social security number to freeze your credit. While you can sometimes initiate this online, it‚Äôs better to do it by phone. Fees for freezing your credit [vary by state](https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/research/consumers-unions-guide-to-security-freeze-protection-2/). To freeze your credit, contact:

- Equifax: 1 (800) 349-9960, [https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/](https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/)
- Experian: 1 (888) 397‚Äë3742, [https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html](https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html).
- TransUnion: 1 (888) 909-8872, [https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze) or [https://service.transunion.com/dss/orderStep1_form.page](https://service.transunion.com/dss/orderStep1_form.page)
- Innovis: 1 (800) 540-2505, [https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityFreeze](https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityFreeze) or [https://www.innovis.com/securityFreeze/index](https://www.innovis.com/securityFreeze/index)

### Explore any privacy options offered by your state‚Äôs motor vehicle department.

### Contact your home and mobile phone companies to see if they offer privacy options, such as not listing your number on caller ID or allowing you to opt out of sales of phone numbers.

### Consider opting out of direct marketing and telemarketing.
This list, compiled by Griffin Boyce, has a lot of information on doing so: [https://github.com/glamrock/data-brokers/blob/master/data-brokers.md](https://github.com/glamrock/data-brokers/blob/master/data-brokers.md). It was last updated in 2019.

You can also opt out of targeted ads using cookies and similar technology at the browser level at https://optout.aboutads.info.

### Opt out of prescreened credit offers
Follow the instructions at [https://www.optoutprescreen.com/](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/)

### Get on the Do Not Call Registry

## Paid options

[Brand Yourself](https://brandyourself.com/), [DeleteMe](https://joindeleteme.com/), [EasyOptOuts](https://easyoptouts.com/), [IDX Privacy](https://www.idx.us/idx-privacy), [Kanary](https://www.thekanary.com/), [OneRep](https://onerep.com/), [Optery](https://www.optery.com), [Privacy Pros](https://privacypros.io/), [Reputation.com](Reputation.com), [Reputation Defender](https://www.reputationdefender.com/), and [Spartacus](https://spartacus.com) all offer different opt-out services. Of these options, I have personally paid for and had good experiences with DeleteMe and Kanary. In general, note that removal services are not comprehensive, as some data brokers do not allow third parties to remove listings, and removal services do not include every data broker on this list, let alone outside of it. 

There are services for media mail as well. For a fee, [PaperKarma](https://www.paperkarma.com/product/paperkarma-subscription/) will remove your name from common direct mail vendors, including charity solicitations, direct mail and catalogs. Also for a fee, [DMAChoice](https://dmachoice.org/static/consumer_choice_tools.php), will remove your name from prospective mailers, not including political mail or mail from companies you‚Äôve done business with in the past two years. You¬†can also remove your name from [Valpak coupon packs](https://www.valpak.com/remove-address), for free.
