_Disclaimers: Some of these opt-outs take a long time to go through. Sometimes, information is pulled from other sources and youâ€™ll need to opt out multiple times for the same site. Data brokers come and go (and are bought out by others), and they also often change their opt-out pages. I try to update this ~every six months, but itâ€™s not always current. Finally, even opting out of these sites doesnâ€™t mean that your address is secure. In many states, real estate data and voter registration information is public (or easy to obtain). And, of course, location data can be found by physical means (e.g., following you home) and through other people who know it (i.e., social engineering). That said, removing your home address from data broker sites can significantly lower your attack surface and make it harder for people to find it. ðŸ’•_

You can also send a request here [https://support.whitepages.com/hc/en-us/requests/new](https://support.whitepages.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

Also, White Pages also owns [411.com](https://www.411.com/), so check for your information there. The opt-out is the same.

### Xlek

## Special Circumstances

If youâ€™re a victim of violent crime or identity theft, itâ€™s often possible to opt out of information that others canâ€™t opt out of. You may, however, need to provide court orders or other information. It may be worth checking more complete data broker lists which include those: [https://www.privacyrights.org/data-brokers](https://www.privacyrights.org/data-brokers) See this resource: [https://nnedv.org/mdocs-posts/people-searches-data-brokers/](https://nnedv.org/mdocs-posts/people-searches-data-brokers/)

## Preventing Identity Theft &amp; Opting Out of Marketing Sites

### ðŸ“ž Consider freezing your credit
, which prevents creditors from accessing your credit report. (It also prevents credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name, but you will receive a pin to unfreeze your credit, if needed.) You will need to provide personal information such as your name, address, date of birth, and social security number to freeze your credit. While you can sometimes initiate this online, itâ€™s better to do it by phone. Fees for freezing your credit [vary by state](http://consumersunion.org/research/consumers-unions-guide-to-security-freeze-protection-2/). To freeze your credit, contact:

- Equifax: 1 (800) 349-9960, [https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/](https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/)
- Experian: 1 (888) 397â€‘3742, [https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html](https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html) or [https://www.experian.com/ncaconline/freeze](https://www.experian.com/ncaconline/freeze)
- TransUnion: 1 (888) 909-8872, [https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze) or [https://service.transunion.com/dss/orderStep1_form.page](https://service.transunion.com/dss/orderStep1_form.page)
- Innovis: 1 (800) 540-2505, [https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityFreeze](https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityFreeze) or [https://www.innovis.com/securityFreeze/index](https://www.innovis.com/securityFreeze/index)

### Explore any privacy options
offered by your stateâ€™s motor vehicle department.

### Contact your home and mobile phone companies
to see if they offer privacy options, such as not listing your number on caller ID or allowing you to opt out of sales of phone numbers.

### Consider opting out of direct marketing and telemarketing.
This list, compiled by Griffin Boyce, has a lot of information on doing so: [https://github.com/glamrock/data-brokers/blob/master/data-brokers.md](https://github.com/glamrock/data-brokers/blob/master/data-brokers.md). A good place to start is to opt out at the Direct Marketing Association. [https://dmachoice.thedma.org/register.php](https://dmachoice.thedma.org/register.php)

### Opt out of prescreened credit offers
Follow the instructions at [https://www.optoutprescreen.com/](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/)

### Get on the Do Not Call Registry
[https://www.donotcall.gov/register/reg.aspx](https://www.donotcall.gov/register/reg.aspx)

## Paid options

DeleteMe, PrivacyDuck, OneRep, Reputation Defender and Reputation.com all offer different opt-out services. However, these are not comprehensive, as some data brokers do not allow third parties to remove listings.
